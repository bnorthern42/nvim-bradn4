# PERSONAL NVIM CONFIGS

My personal journey in switching from emacs as my Gen. Purpose editor to NeoVim. for small projects. (simple file edits still belong to Vim and/or Kate)


## TODOS
- Fix compiler.nvim (works so that you can 'so' the packer file then compiler.lua file, but loading nvim calls an error when loading on it's own about compiler.nvim not being a plugin it is aware of.
- Add topline file/edit/settings/ maybe a gui layer for changing themes on the fly
- add a terminal panel
- add keybinds for splitting windows (eventually workspaces, i.e. working accross multiple TUI NVim interfaces on same project., taking place of window manager so to speak... may just be best to write a keybind func in OpenBox)
- Add project support like projectile for emacs
- add which key support (like emacs has)
- add dashboard (like emacs)
